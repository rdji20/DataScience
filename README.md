## prompt_engineering_opia
Bot creation with obstetrics hospital in Mexico for pregnancy triage using Microsoft Semantic Kernel. This is an ongoing project as of 06/20/2023.  
<br>


## Recommendation_Xperience_Research
Recommendation Experience (RX) informal research. After reading Proffesor Michael Schrage's book on Recommendation Engines I became interested in recommendations' future as well as topics regarding decisions such as Decision Thoeory and Behavioral Economics; which are essential for a good recommendation. This is the start and "doodling" research of something I want to keep pursuing as I continue my career in information sciences specially information retrieval.
<br>


## Poor_mood_analysis
Analysis to understand the correlation and probable prediction of bad mood related with time spend watching a screen.
<br>


## UserAcquisitionBump
Analysis to understand startup user acquisition model to see how much it will cost Bump LLC per year.
<br>


## WebScrapperCards
Naive bot to scrape local businesses information for startup recommendations
<br>


## bump_Recsys
Creation of different approaches to mitigate zero shot recommendaton problem. Usage of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and TF IDF.
<br>


## bump_food_drinks
Web scrapper to gather information of local business in the industry of food and drinks. 
<br>


## content_based_filtering_with_LLM
After research on GPT-3 and word embeddings, I decided to change LDA for OpenAI word embeddings as recommendation system. Using user's prompt on things they like as the starting point for recommendation which simiilarity would be coomputed against cards' words embeddings.

## sodium_fastfood_analysis
Published html [RPubs Fastfood Analysis](https://rpubs.com/rdji20/1065475). <br>
Laboratory excercise for Data Science masters for descriptive statistics on the usage of sodium (salt) for different items in fastfood chains like McDonalds and ChickFilA to understand if we can determine healthier fastfood by having the premise of salt being unhealthy for people with high blood pressure.
