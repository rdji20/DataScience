# DataScience

These are my projects for DataScience and Machine Learning / Data Engineering:

For my startup bump I am creating a search and recommendation assistant for personalization of things to do in Seattle. I use different methods such as natural language processing, implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for categorization, and Large language models as recommendation systems (LMRecsys). 

What you can find in the files are web scrappers, Data Science projects oriented to the recommendation problem of cold start, research, among other things.
