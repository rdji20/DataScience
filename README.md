# DataScience

These are my projects for Data Science and Machine Learning:

For my startup bump I created recommendation assistant for personalization of things to do in Seattle. I use different methods such as natural language processing, implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for categorization, and Large language models as recommendation systems (LMRecsys). 

What you can find in the files are web scrappers, Data Science projects oriented to the recommendation problem of cold start, research, among other things.
