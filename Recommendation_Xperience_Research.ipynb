    "# Recommendation Experience (RX) Research\n",
    "by Roberto Infante\n",
    "\n",
    "This research consists on the exploration of multiple topics which together emerge in Recommendation Experience (RX). These topics include decision theory, choice architecture, behavioral economics, behavioural science, and social psychology. The motivation for this research is that I'm creating a recommendation engine for user personalization of real world activities to do in a city. I'm using OpenAI GPT-3 language model to get the embedded vectors from the place's descriptions."

    "## Decision Theory\n",
    "Decision theory, as written by the stanford enyclopedia of philosophy, is concerned with the reasoning underlying an agent's choices, whether this is a mundane choice between taking the bus or getting a taxi, or a more far-reaching choice about whether to pursue a demanding political career. Decsion theory is as much a theory of beliefs, desires and other relevant attitudes as it is a theory of choice; what matters is how these various attitudes (preference attitudes) cohere together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this is a normative decision theory, which means that the main question is to understand the preference attitudes should satisfy in any generic circumstance. This amounts to minimal account of *rationality*. The key issue for a minimal account is the treatment of uncertainty. (EU) expected utility theory says that in situations of uncertainty one should prefer the option with the greatest expected desirability or value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that preference is a comparative attitude. When an agent prefers option A over B, we mean that the agent takes A ro be more desirable or choice-worthy than B. When there are more than 2 options (E.g. A,B,C,D and E) we speak of this preference as an agent's preference ordering. We then have to axioms that have to be met in order to support the rational preference over options. <br>\n",
    ">The axiom of completeness <br>\n",
    "That for any A,B ∈ S : either A⪯B or B⪯A. <br>\n",
    "The axiom of transitivity <br>\n",
    "For any A,B,C∈S: if A⪯B and B⪯C then A⪯C. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the set of prospect/options is finite, any weak order of the options in S can be represented by an ordinal utility function. For any A,B in S : u(A) <= u(B) means that A has as weak or weaker order than B. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can have the Theorem of Ordinal Representation. Let S be a finite set, and ⪯ a weak preference relation on S. Then there is an ordinal utility function that represents ⪯ just in case ⪯ is complete and transitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one problem with this theorem though. We can have an order of let's say A,B,C; but we don’t know the cardinal distance between them. We want to know how much better an option is than the others. This is why Ramsey and von Neumann and Morgensten constructed a new option L (or the lottery option) that has A and C as its possible prices. The basic idea is that the judgment about B relative to C on the one hand and A on the other, can be measured by the riskiness of the lottery L involving C and A tat you deem equally as desirable as B. The main word here is indifference. When the agent is indifferent of doing activity B or entering the lottery and having the opportunity to do activity C 3/4 of the time; this means that activity B has a **utility** of 3/4 if utility of the activity that the person least wants to do is 0 (A=0) and the activity that the person wants to do the most is 1 (C=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to understand though that since the utilities of options can only be determined relative to the utilities of other options, there is no such thing as the absolute utility of an option. Second, by the same reasoning, neither interval-valued nor ordinal utility measures are interpersonally commensurable with respect to levels and units of utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all good but to fill the gaps in reasioning about the assumption that lotteries are evaluated in terms of expected utility, we can analyze the vNM theorem which shores up the gaps by shifting the attention back to the preference relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first define, in formal terms, the expected utility of a lottery: Let Li be a lottery from the set L of lotteries, and Oik the outcome, or prize, of lottery Li that arises with probability pik. The expected utility of Li is then defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "here is the vNM equation:\n",
    "$$ EU(L_i) =  \\sum_{k} u(O_{ik}) * p_{ik}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds two other axioms. \n",
    ">The axiom of continuity <br>\n",
    "Suppose A⪯B⪯C. Then there is a p∈[0,1] such that {pA, (1-p)C} ~ B <br>\n",
    "The axiom of independence <br>\n",
    "Suppose A⪯B. Then for any C and any p∈[0,1]: {pA, (1-p)C} ⪯ {pB, (1-p)C} <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The question here is: How to compute the utility value with implicit interactions? Or if it cannot be this way, how can we explicitely compute the utility value (using L set) without diminishing the RX?\n",
    "\n",
    "A good KPI to see if we are diminishing the RX is by analysing by keeping the same variables constant and check how the churn behaves. "

    "### Agent's preference ordering\n",
    "I'm going to test a utility function by using the agent's ordering as the main input for the content based activity recommendations order. This means that depending on the order I'm going to use the axiom of independence in order to arrange the cards and maximize the expected utility. This is a form of using explicit interaction for L computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the preference ordering is tricky because the least value is not supposed to be something that the person doesn't want to do but rather something that is not as desirable as the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach I will use is to have predefined values of desirability which are going to be part of the utility function. In this case I will have values from 1 to 3 to categorize the activities (1 being the least desirable and 3 the most)."

From here, you can see the entire city skyline and the Saddledome – which makes for a picture-perfect way to watch the 2022 NYE fireworks show. Take it in, folks. There really is nothing like it. \n",

The majority of their menu is just ramen, so they know what they’re doing. Their meat is done just right, and their broth is always perfect. There’s a lot to chose from at this place, so beware fellow indecisive menu grasers. \n",

       "1688    Q: What’s your favourite way to drink Dewar’s? A: One of my go-to ways to enjoy Dewar’s Scotch Whisky is definitely in an Old Fashioned cocktail with Dewar’s 12 YO—but the Dewar’s White Label on the rocks or with a tiny bit of water is a close second! A: Describe your perfect occasion to enjoy a Dewar’s cocktail, and why!  A: I don’t really need an “occasion,” per se… but if I had to choose one, I’d say after dinner for a nightcap. It’s the perfect way to end an evening with great company, where I would most likely get a smokey Old Fashioned.  I love the combination of citrus, a smoked glass for aromatics, and quite honestly any of the Dewar’s lineup- but for a cocktail as iconic as the Old Fashioned, you’ll probably want to go for Dewar’s 12 YO or 15 YO if available. However, Dewar’s White Label is still one of my faves.  Q: What makes Dewar’s your go-to for a scotch? A: Hands down the fact that it has both some peaty tones (but not too much) and a touch of sweetness, which makes it just a fantastic, well rounded blend that is perfect for sipping but truly elevates a cocktail as well. Q: What are your favourite types of scotch whisky cocktails to create? A: As I previously mentioned, I do love making a smokey Old Fashioned cocktail, but also the simplicity of some straight Dewar’s with a touch of water to open it up… and if I feel like changing things up, I use soda water instead. But another one is a Roy Rob with a maraschino cherry. If I’m looking for something more refreshing then I’d make a Julep (although it does take a little more effort) or even a classic Rob Roy. Q: What are your thoughts on drinking whisky neat or on the rocks? A: I’m definitely not a neat room temperature whisky drinker. I much prefer on the rocks or with a touch of water or even soda,as I mentioned above. It really does open up the whisky, so I can enjoy the more subtle character.  Q: In your opinion, why do you think people are often apprehensive of exploring the world of scotch whisky? A: I think most people are intimidated by how strong it is. Many have possibly caught a sniff of it before and think it smells too much like alcohol, and the fact that it’s a higher alcohol percentage, but the truth is they just might not be approaching it the right way.  Much like tequila, there’s a certain way to sniff it to avoid just inhaling all the alcohol vapours off the top. For one, keeping your mouth slightly open, tipping the glass and slowly bringing it up to your nose and taking it away and then back again, to allow yourself to process it all and then go in for a small sip, roll it around in your mouth and then go in for a second one. It’s  amazing how big of a difference it makes. Now you get to truly experience the spirit for what it is and savour the various flavours etc.  But another reason might be just because typically most scotch whisky cocktails aren’t as watered down. They’re typically bolder, and pack a punch for those who aren’t as familiar with it then say a gin or vodka cocktail. But I have yet to meet anyone who’s taken the time to truly experience and experiment with scotch whisky that hasn’t fallen in love with it. Q: What would be your go to tip(s) for introducing first-timer friends to this spirit? A: Taking the right approach to discovering the spirit before you drink it is a good start.. Roll it around in the glass, ideally a proper glass – like a cognac snifter, burgundy glass, or a whiskey tumbler- not just a wine or water glass, and definitely nothing plastic.  Admire its colour, look at the legs and how fast or slow it slips down the side of the glass, and then go in with the nose, followed by a couple sips. Then experiment, and have fun with it. There’s no right or wrong way, but here’s my usual process.  Take a sip neat, then try adding a little water. Start with a couple drops, and then a little more. Then, try some on the rocks…whether that’s with a boulder ice ball, a large cube or any regular ice you may already have at home–or even crushed–how it changes the flavours etc. is mind blowing.  Once you figure out the best ways you enjoyed it, you’ll be hooked. Next you can experiment with the cocktails. The best part is most scotch whisky cocktails are quite simple. If you have some bitters and martini vermouth, you’re smooth sailing. But make sure to pick up some quality maraschino cherries too. It makes a world of a difference—only the best, for the best. Cheers! \n",

Pho Dau Bo is an incredibly tasty and traditional family-run restaurant. They’ve been around since 2008, and in that time have perfected the art of flavourful soups. Their broth is cooked for a whopping 16 hours and they use fresh ingredients. Pho lovers should definitely check this place out! Order online here \n",

All those dark color schemes, soundtracks, and scenes really help us get in the mood for spooky season. But did you know that Seattle’s MoPOP has an exhibition that celebrates all things horror year-round? Yep, horror fans this one is for you. MoPOP’s Scared to Death: The Thrill of Horror Film is a permanent exhibition and is included in your ticket each time you visit. So no need to pay extra to see more than 50 props and costumes from your film and television horror favorites. Recent Posts:\\n10 of the best things to do in & around Seattle this week (October 18-22)\\nSeattle just got the nation’s first Hokkaido-style soft-serve spot & it’s time to try it Just which movies can you see props from? Expect to see items from A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, The Walking Dead, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Bride of Frankenstein, Dawn of the Dead, Hostel, Jeepers Creepers, Pet Sematary, and more. And if that’s not enough for you, MoPOP let Curiocity in on a little secret and that is the addition of the “Candyman” hook from 1992 and Sutter Cane books from “In the Mouth of Madness.” While seeing the objects is cool, the exhibit is just about as cinematic as the films themselves. See if you can survive a vampire’s lair dripping with blood and try not to scream when you see suspended corpses framing a killer’s den. But if you do make it through all that you’ll also be able to see extensive exhibit films, oral history interviews with the genre’s top directors, and also some interactive photo ops.

From fossils to sauropods, we’ll forever be down to clown with the prehistoric era, and this year, we’ll be first in line when North America’s largest and “most realistic” dinosaur expo, Jurassic Quest, rolls into Calgary. This April, between the 8th and 10th, touch, stomp, and ride on the backs of life-sized lizards from before the earth was well-established. “In collaboration with leading paleontologists, each dinosaur has been painstakingly replicated in every detail,” they explain on their website. Recent Posts\\nThe Northern Lights put on a show last night – here’s what to expect in Canada this week\\nOne Canadian spot makes new ranking of the world’s most romantic hotels  “Whether their prehistoric counterpart had skin that was scaly, had feathers or fur, Jurassic Quest has spared no expense in bringing the dinosaurs to life.” Featuring several of these unreal animatronic creatures, a 50-foot megalodon, a fossil dig, and a bounce house for your littles, this indoor exhibit has travelled the world and will soon occupy YYC’s BMO Centre. Tickets are on sale now and range between $22 and $45 – but hurry. These bad boys are projected to sell out quickly and you your kids, nephews and nieces won’t want to miss it. \n",

The 17th annual Snowflake Lane is returning nightly at the Bellevue Collection starting this Friday, November 26th. You’ll be able to watch as the sidewalks fill with people hoping to catch a glimpse of this unique PNW holiday tradition. If you’ve never attended Snowflake Lane before, it takes place nightly at 7 pm throughout the holiday season. Spectators gather on the sidewalks between Bellevue Square and Lincoln Square from NE 4th to NE 8th to watch as Bellevue slips away and is replaced with a winter wonderland. Expect to see falling snow, dazzling lights, festive music, toy drummers, and dancers.

And, that means the return of the beloved Vancouver Cherry Blossom Fest. Throughout April, you’ll be able to check out a variety of great activities, events, and more! Here’s what to know about it. The first major event to check out is The Big Picnic, which takes place on April 2nd. This year, the organizers will be setting up in David Lam Park, where guests can enjoy live music, food trucks, and art installations, including a showcase of last year’s winning haiku.

With dozens of different installations stretching practically across the entire zoo, the experience is a great way to deal with those early sundown blues we all know and love. \n",

    "As we see there are still some cards that need to be curated but I will ignore this and continue to the evaluation of the ordering cards thesis.\n",

    "This ordering is depending on the things I already like, therefore I'm trying to cancel out the transferable issue since we know now that the users chose a set of cards from the random set of options we provided them and these cards are now in a set of things they'll like to do.In addition, iff the users organize the cards in the \"desirability\" section on their profile, then we don't have the problem of not knowing the cardinal distance between each of the cards. The only problem with this \"explicitely ranking approach\" is that we are going to have just 3 activites values (1,2,3 depending on how desirable are the activites to the user), which can bias the true utility of the activities' choices. Anyways, we can use this as a proxy for the following lottery variables in the recommendation choices we are going to display to the user for explorability and exploitability. \n",

    "Here we are going to see if we can have a generalized scale for personalization where we can define how much a person would like to do certain activity and the comparisson between the user's choices ordering and to what extend we can define a user's profile for later recommendation of other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an oppoortunity here to decide if the first batch of cards we show to the user should be random or user oriented. But for now we are going to use randomness for eassiness when testing our results. "
